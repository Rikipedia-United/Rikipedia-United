<h1>How I Make My Website</h1>
<p>I start off by running and typing <code>code</code> through <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy</a>, where it is called a project still. Then I run it through my command line using commands like <code>new-item [file path and name.html]</code> and <code>set-content"[the html code]"<br></code>Then I publish it using <a href = "https://github.com/riki-pedia/riki"> GitHub</a> (link leads to raw github version of page) and wait for it to turn into <a href = "https://riki-pedia.github.io/riki">This</a>.</p>
